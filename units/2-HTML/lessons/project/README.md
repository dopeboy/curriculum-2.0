#Scope
This project asks the student to create a webpage that is designed like a social media page. The focus here is not to have functioning links or even a functioning page. The focus here is to have a page that resembles something you see on social media. Students will be able to complete this using the skills the have already learned in class.
 
#Before Class
Take a look at the 

#During Class

##Do Now
As the students walk into class they are asked to compare and contrast designs from various social media sites. Write down qualities of each.


##Opening
Whether we have a social media account or not we know what they look like. If you had your own social media site what would everyone's bio page look like?

##Lecture
Today in class you are all going to make your own social media bio page.

##Project Creation Time
#####Brianstorming/Prototyping
Before students are given a computer they must make a paper mock up of how they would like their page to be laid out. 

#####Build Time
Students may work alone or pair program (teachers should use their own discretion.) The teacher's role will be to walk around the room helping students with any quesitons they have. Students are encouraged to look at previous lessons for reference.

##Closing
Each student will present their social media site. While presenting they should explain what they were going for and where their inspiration came from.  
After students have presented, the class should vote on which site they would want to join first. 

##Check for Understanding
Teachers should keep track of student success while they are presenting to the class.
