## Before class
---
###Teacher Preperation
* A further understanding of Scratch. Teacher should be familiar with sensing, control and data blocks.
* The teacher should create a two variable MadLibs program with a logic condition before entering the classroom.


### Daily Objective

* Students will be able to create and implement a variable in a Scratch program.  
* Student will be able to implement Boolean logic using an if/else block in a Scratch program. 

### Key points

* A variable, like the variables you use in Math class is a placeholder for a changing value.
* Variables are like boxes; they store something.
* Variables have a name and a value.
* If/Else statements let us set a condition and execute different code based on whether the condition is met.

### Assessment

1. Written Do-Now task (Printed MadLibs activity)


### Vocabulary

* Variable
* Logic
* Boolean

## During class

### Do-now

1. Attendance: http://scripted.org/attendance
2. Hand students a printed copy of a MadLibs activity OR students may complete online version (links provided in reference section.)

## Opening

“Please complete the MadLibs activity as a refresher to the parts of speech.” Allow 3-4 minutes to complete. Once complete have some students share their MadLibs game. Then have a class conversation revolving around variables in a game of MadLibs. Main focus of conversation should be:

* A variable is a container that stores a value (like noun) and inputs it into the story in a predetermined place decided by the creator.

## Introduction of new material (“I Do”)

Slowly create, while asking questions from student volunteers, a “Hello, Name” program on the board. Students should have Scratch open and be following along with you as you create “Hello, Name.”

## Guided Practice ("We do")

“We have just created a program that can say hello to you. However we did not use a variable. Let’s remake this program, but this time using a variable called ![Image](http://i.imgur.com/DUoOcHr.png.) ” The teacher may decide whether or not to create the variable together or allow students to figure out on their own)


**Extension activity:** Create a program that says hello to you and your friend.


## Independent practice ("You do")

“Now that we understand how variables work, let’s recreate the Ol’ McDonald MadLibs from the start of class. This time in Scratch.”

## Introduction of new material #2(“I Do”)


“Looks great! Everyone has a working MadLibs game. Now let’s alter that program a little bit. Let's first ask the user if they would like to play MadLibs. We can do this by adding in a question with an if/else statement at the start of this program.”  


The teacher should then provide a quick demonstration of how Boolean logic functions in programming. Do this by creating the program below on the board while student laptops are closed. Afterwards you can explain how a human uses if/else when asking a yes or no question.

## Independent practice #2 ("You do")
Then allow students to complete this task on their own. The final product should resemble the program below.

## Closing/ Homework

“Today we covered the basics of using variables and Boolean logic in programming. You are uncovering more about how a program thinks. Next we will be using some real programming languages to apply the concepts we learned here in Scratch today.”

##Check for understanding: Submitting this project
The teacher must ask students to share the link to their project on your school's [Project Submission Form.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheets/d/1kaVH9hmkDCbBul19583UMPxl6IJ3-4pHgBQ2BU6TKDk/edit#gid=0)


##Homework
Students can log into Scratch at home and create a game that uses a variable to keep score. This assignment does not technically need to be graded but should be seen as a way for students to explore further into Scratch outside of class. 

## After Class
* Take a quick look at each Scratch project from today. Students who were not able to create the program should be asked to recreate the project, with teacher’s help, next class.
* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
